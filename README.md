# Equipify
Responsive college gym equipment project website.


on this project i made the code with HTML, CSS native and swiper js

The reason i build this without a bootstrap or any other template libraries, is that i believe in order to be a good website developer
you have to get your hand dirty by writing the actual code. with that, i will have a strong foundation in programming that will be beneficial
for me in my career.

I learned a lot while doing this project, on designing/developing a website. although it may still buggy on some devices though.
